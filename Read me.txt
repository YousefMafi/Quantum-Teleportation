In this study, we use Matlab 2014a software for analysis of quantum noise channel effect on teleportation protocol results.
The Matlab codes file consist of two main .m files:

1) Main.m:
          The main code for calculating fidelity with two different noise and all density matrixes.

2) Fidelity_average.m:
	  The plotting code for the average fidelity.

The description of all code parts is written in Matlab files for each line.
